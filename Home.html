          <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">1.Existing platforms lack focus</h2>
          Existing social media platforms often fall short in meeting the specific needs of students, leading to significant challenges in their academic lives. Primarily, these general platforms lack the focus necessary to cater to the unique demands of student engagement and collaboration. While they offer various features for social interaction, they do not provide the tailored tools essential for academic networking and resource sharing. As a result, students struggle to find dedicated spaces that support their educational pursuits, which can diminish motivation and effectiveness in their studies.
          <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">2.Difficulty in academic collaboration</h2>
          In addition to this lack of focus, students face considerable difficulties in academic collaboration. The options available for working together on projects or forming study groups are limited and often scattered across multiple platforms. This fragmentation makes it challenging for students to connect with peers who share similar academic goals, stifling collaboration and creativity. Without a cohesive environment designed for teamwork, students may resort to disorganized methods, which ultimately hampers their ability to learn from one another.
          <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">3.Overwhelming information overload</h2>
          Moreover, the overwhelming information overload on general social media platforms adds another layer of difficulty. Students are frequently inundated with irrelevant content, advertisements, and distractions that divert their attention away from academic matters. This noise makes it hard for them to focus on essential information, leading to frustration and decreased engagement in their studies.
          To effectively support students, there is a pressing need for specialized platforms that prioritize their academic needs. By creating dedicated spaces that enhance collaboration, streamline communication, and reduce distractions, we can empower students to connect meaningfully with their peers and thrive in their academic endeavors.

            <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">1. Data Encryption</h2>
             <p><strong>Data encryption is a critical measure for safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access. It involves converting plaintext data into a coded format that can only be read by someone who possesses the decryption key.</strong></p>
              <p>  
              <b>At Rest Encryption:</b>
                <ul>
                <li>Database Encryption: Sensitive data stored in databases (e.g., user profiles, grades, payment information) should be encrypted using strong encryption standards (e.g., AES-256). This protects data even if the database is compromised.</li>
                <li>File Encryption: Any files uploaded by users (e.g., assignments, personal documents) should also be encrypted both during upload and when stored on the server.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
          <p><strong>Two-factor authentication adds an additional layer of security to user accounts by requiring not just a password, but also a second form of verification.</strong></p>
          <b>Implementation of 2FA:</b>
              <ul>
            <li>User-Friendly Experience:
                Clear Instructions: Provide easy-to-follow instructions for enabling and using 2FA. Include visual guides and FAQs to help users understand the process.</li>
              <li>Backup Codes: Generate one-time backup codes for users to access their accounts in case they lose access to their primary 2FA method.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Profile Privacy Settings: Allow users to customize their profile visibility (e.g., public, friends only, private). Users should be able to manage who can see their academic achievements, contact information, and any shared content.</li>
